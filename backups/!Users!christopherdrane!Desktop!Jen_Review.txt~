I feel very satisified with my performance this year. Of all my accomplishments this year, I am most proud of the website redesign. We launched smoothly and have received significant positive feedback about the site. I believe it has set a new model for how Foundation Center can look at content accessibility in other areas. I already see some of that modeling come through in how web services is approaching its work [csd: Revise.]. It is also improving the way that Erin and I can approach our work and experiment with new ideas, because the structure was designed as a usable building block [csd: I don't understand this sentence; you might want to elaborate or remove.].

I am confident that I have met content expectations. GrantCraft's blogs have been explosive - we've averaged about one guest post a week - as has our video content - which I often secured by seizing unintentional opportunities, like with Taproot and Exponent Philanthropy. Forms of content that we didn't have before - including Foundation Center features and Guided Reading - are also all new. We have many new translations in our library, which is an asset to GrantCraft's global audience and to further differentiate us from competitors. Finally, when I made these goals last year, I'm not sure that I had conceived the structure of Takeaways in full; if we count those (and we should - that's brilliantly-written content that was buried for years!), I created hundreds of content pieces! Ultimately though, the two things I've been most pleased with regarding content are that (1) content on the new site all matches the GrantCraft standard of quality (tone, accessibility, perspective), and (2) it's been dynamic; we now have new content every week.

This year I continued to meet with many external audiences. When I did not have direct contacts with an event or an organization, I would find reason to invite myself. I've spoken publicly in front of more than 15 audiences this year - including Philanthropy Ohio, GIFE, Grants Mangers Network, Exponent Philanthropy - and been the primary Foundation Center representative in countless other meetings with other foundations, sector partners, civil society organizations, and people who are interested in our work. I like to think of my external presence as a way of changing the face of the Foundation Center that we heard is a Hillary Clinton-esque lady from the brand realignment survey. I believe I've excelled in this beyond expectation because many times, the follow-up goes well beyond GrantCraft. For example, after meeting with ECAS, I cultivated that relationship into a contract for an IssueLab knowledge center.

Curation and engagement has gone well - blogs, social media, IssueLab tie-in, the newsletter, and in-person connection have all been exceedingly positive. But I'm still not satisfied. I believe that engagement should be deeper. There's an inherent problem in that it is difficult to measure offline engagement. Next year I hope to roll out a "Ladder of Engagement" model so that I can benchmark what engagement looks like.

Strategy- In many ways, strategy has remained reactive. This manifested this year with how the website was structured and implemented. But clear strategies are starting to emerge [csd: this phrase seems like fluff]. I am learning how to balance taking proactive strategies with reserving the right to trust my judgment and be strategically reactive, too [csd: you need to rewrite this.]. My two day strategy retreat was very helpful in clarifying my own thinking on various aspects of GrantCraft and my work, and I hope to block more time to have these "thinking" days in the year ahead [csd: what does this last sentence add?].

I think where I've truly shined has been with "Other Projects as Assigned". Many of these projects were not assigned, but rather evolved organically!. Almost everything here connects loosely with GrantCraft in some way, but I took on a lot of other work beyond the core of my job description...and loved it! In broad brush strokes, these include:
  • design thinking - learning it and infusing it into the Center; 
  • online donations - making it happen for the Center;
  • cultivating grant opportunities and contracts - I brought in $158,000 since my last review and have more in the pipeline [csd: you need to elevate this; it's almost a footnote right now];
  • youth philanthropy - this went from being a pet project to a likely portal project
  • creating learning opportunities/talent development - effective meetings, improvisation, teaching soft skills to various junior staff
  • connecting staff across departments and offices and (attempting) cross pollination opportunities - I made a point to know what was  happening in different places and find strategic connections
  • move committee participation - primary role = "disturbance generator" [csd: what does this mean?]
  • brand realignment participation - primary role = "disturbance generator" [csd: ditto]
  • piloting the API integration with IssueLab - included strategic thinking about functionality
  • spend down working group - started as cultivation and working on a multi-faceted approach for providing a package of services to these
  foundations
  • being publicly visible through communications - mentions in at least 9 articles/blogs and active use of personal twitter for  professional purposes
  • attempting to consolidate newsletters starting with eUpdates for grantmakers - long conversation, success pending, significant enough amount of time spent to include here
  • ....and more

I include this list because I feel as though the better part of my role has morphed into an internal opportunity cultivator. I've enjoyed it and I think I've performed well. I do feel slightly frustrated in that, because it's such an informal, ambiguous role, it's hard to quantify or otherwise measure performance. Never the less, I have heard a lot of positive, generous feedback from colleagues about this aspect of my work and overall approach.

Lastly, Erin and Davis have been a delight to manage, and I've created what I hope to be a culture of openness, opportunity, and trust. Erin recently shared that she feels very empowered and appreciates my ability to delegate just the right amount.
