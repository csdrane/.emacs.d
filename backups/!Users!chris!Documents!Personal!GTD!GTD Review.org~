** Alan Watts
- The feeling of the "isolated I" is part of the game, and it has no fundamental reality except as a convention. So long as this is not clear, we are confused. We can only return to the child's (infant's) view, by realizing that this independent I does not exist. There is nothing you can do, or not do, to achieve this. Trying only serves to aggrevate the feeling of the separate ego.
- When you get the feeling in your mind that this is a difficult point of view to acquire, know that this idea is one that you are putting there to stop yourself from seeing the other point of view. Above all, you must not take this seriously. It is simply a method of postponing seeing the point now. So you have to see it now or never. Because there is only now.
- If we can see that the ego is purely fictitious, that it is a symbol or  image of oneself, plus a feeling of muscular strain occassioned by trying to make this symbol an effective agent--to control emotion, to concentrate, to direct the nervous operations of the organism--then immediately it is clear that what we have called ourselves isn't able to do anything at all. What then follows is a kind of silence, where all it is able to do is watch itself. And so we end up in the state of meditation, or contemplation.
- It is characteristic of Zen practitioners to act at once. This doesn't allow apprehensiveness or anxiety to distract them.
- Not only is the ego a mere construct, but so are all the "vibrations" (n.b. Watt's term, which I assume must have been fashionable at the time. These vibrations include such things as colors, concepts, etc.) We only know things in relation to other things. If other colors didn't exist, we wouldn't know what red is. We know of red by contrasting it against other colors. So too with the ideas of good, bad, pleasant, painful. Eventually we arrive at a point where we realize that all values that we put on the vibrations are arbitrary. Eventually we see the vibrations just as vibrations. Every vibration that's possible implies all the others. From a child's point of view, any one can be completely fascinating. Not because it means anything, but just for what it is--e.g. that it is shaped so.
- We are headed towards what the Buddhists call "Tathatā," (pronounced tatata) or suchness. The buddhist pronounciation represents the feeling in meditation in which everything is "ta."
- You're not saying anymore, "well that doesn't amount to anything. Because you've learned, that when people do take you to the place that does amount to something, eventually it all collapses. The price of being taken to place seriously, where it really does amount to something--the price you pay is the horrors, its opposite. To the degree that you take that seriously, you take the horrors.
- E.g. you are madly in love with someone and learn they like you too. You're ecstatic. This is the great event. But then you start worrying. That they might get hurt, that they might fall out of love with you. These are the horrors. They always lurk behind the triumph of getting this intense, gorgeous feeling.
- If you know that this is in a way an illusion, you can allow yourself to take it quite seriously. But always having a hint of "gadanke," way back, that this is the game. Having that, you can take it seriously, allow yourself to get involved in life to the most ridiculous degree, because you know it's all right. It's just these ridiculous vibrations. This is why someone who might be enlightened does not always present a detached attitude.
- If someone is always detached and reserved, it indicates a primordial fear of getting involved.
- In a sense, all places are the same place. Wherever you go, whatever you are, you're always in the middle of things, butressed by large and small extremes on either end. The only time you tend to notice change is during transitions. But mostly we oscillate up and down in a band in the middleness.
- We fool ourselves by attributing powerlessness to nothingness. We don't realize that this is a logical fallacy. It takes nothing to have something. Without nothing something couldn't exist. Nothingness is the fundamental reality. And it's your reality. The mind is essentially void. But this is not to mean nothingness in terms of a bleak emptiness. Nothingness is really like the nothingness of space, which contains the whole universe. It contains the planets, and the stars, the sky and the sects. And it contains you too.
- Nothingness is what we want to talk about when we talk about the spiritual. Only it's all been ignored or put down. Realizing that you are nothing is a source of energy. It lets you feel like there is nothing standing in your way to action. He also discusses thinking of God in terms of nothingness.
- Zen has always described itself as a finger pointed at the moon. "This is concerned with that." Where that is the Sanskrit word for Brahmin. Zen has been summed up in four statements.
  1. A direct transmission, outside scriptures, and apart from tradition.
  2. No dependence on words and letters.
  3. Direct pointing to the human mind.
  4. Seeing into one's own nature and becoming Buddha (enlightened).
- Zen has no doctrines. It has nothing you have to believe. It doesn't moralize.
- Writers on Zen that his pupils were likely to have been exposed to
  - Watts, RH Blyth, DT (maybe Shunryu perhaps) Suzuki
  - All of these write about Chinese Zen. This Zen has a very different flavor than the contemporary Zen practiced in modern Japan.
  - Japanese Zen fetishizes sitting, or zazen.
  - Meanwhile there is also walking zen, standing zen, and lying zen.
- Anyone who says he knows what Zen is, is a fraud. Nobody knows.
  - Just like you don't know who you are. Your name, your certificates, what your friends say about you--you know that these things aren't you.
- Zen is a subdivision of Mahayana Buddhism. That is the school of Buddhism that is concerned with realizing Buddha nature in this world. Not necessarily by renouning everyday life, as if that were an entanglement, but realizing in the midst of life the possibility of becoming a Buddha.
  - Zen is Indianan Mahayana Buddhism translated into Chinese, and therefore heavily influenced by Daoism and Confucianism. Zen monks brought Confucian ideas to Japan.
- Huineng is considered to be the founder of Chinese Zen. He wrote the Platform Sutra, which any student of Zen should read. He emphasized very thoroughly that one should not expect to achieve Buddhahood by sitting down all day long keeping one's mind blank (zazen). Doing so is to be a Stone Buddha rather than a Living Buddha. Those people who think that to be enlightened one must have no emotions whatsoever are confused. Those people might as well be a block of wood or a piece of stone. Instead, your real mind, while all those emotions are going on, is impeturbable. Just like when you move your hand through the sky, you don't leave a track. To be clear minded in the Zen was is not to have no thoughts, but rather your mind isn't sticky. You don't harbor grievances. You aren't attached to the past. You "go with it." Life is flowing all the time (this is the dao). You are flowing along with it whether you want to or not.
- Eventually Zen broke into what are called five houses. Some of these eventually dissolved. Eventually two main forms of Zen existed: Rinzai Zen and Soto Zen. Soto Zen is more serene. Rinzai Zen more gutsy. Rinzai uses the koan method; Soto don't, at least not in the same way.
- During the golden age of Zen, around the end of the first millenium, the primary mode of meditation was walking Zen. All monks were great travelers, and they would walk miles and miles visiting temples.
- You yourself create all the authorities you accept.
- We are in a constant state of social competition. ("I'm wealthier than you.", I'm stronger than you.", I'm more tolerant than you.", I'm more sophisticated than you.", etc.) In terms of this competition, we can of course make mistakes and thereby lose status. But a zen student is a person who is not involved in the status game. That is the real meaning of a monk. To be a master, one must get to the point where he's not trying to be a master. The whole idea of being better than anyone else is seen as being totally meaningless. Each person is in turn just as magnificent as everything else in the universe. And each person being unable to make mistakes even though they think they are making mistakes, as that is their game.
** Books
*** Hacker News: Ask HN: What book changed your life in 2014? https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8716111
- A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy - William B. Irvine
  - Not only a description of the Stoic philosophy, which is, unfortunately, not very well known today, but also a great practical guide to a variety of techniques that can be included into daily activities easily, and will increase happiness.
- Overcoming Gravity: A Systematic Approach to Gymnastics and Bodyweight Strength - Steven Low
  - As I'm growing older (turned 40 last year), I'm no longer inclined to exercise with very heavy weights and was looking into replacing most of the barbell/dumbell exercises in my routine with bodyweight exercise. The book is a great encyclopedia of exercise that can be performed without or with minimal equipment. There are progressions, advice on creating routines, on injury prevention and management and a lot more. There is also a subreddit for those who follow the book
- The War of Art by Steven Pressfield
  - It's written for writers but is relevant broadly. The message is pretty simple and you don't really need to read the whole book to get it. It's one of those keep-driving-the-message self help-ish books.
  - Basically the point is to name and shame "resistance," a catch all term for procrastination, fear and everything else that prevents a writer from writing a book. It also applies to starting a startup, a career, a family, an exercise regime… Like I said, the point is simple and the information could be conveyed in a short essay.
  - The reason for the repetition is to actually realize how big a demonic bottleneck this resistance is and that overcoming it will take effort and more importantly, strategy. It's probably going to derail your plans unless you plan for it. Personifying (or demonifying) it is part of the approach.
  - This is getting further from the book's actual content but the analogy for me is addiction. Say you are an alcoholic. It's not enough to decide to stop drinking, this is a fight. You need to realize that addiction will probably win if you fight stupid. You need a plan to beat addiction. It will fight back. You need to put time and resources into it. Everyone knows this and former alcoholics will start pushing you straight into two things, making sure you realize the scale of the problem and making sure you have a plan. They'll probably recommend AA which gives you a formulaic strategy.
  - Resistance might not be the bottleneck for everyone, but it is for many. For us, we need to make war on it
- Daily Rituals: How Artists Work by Mason Currey
  - It describes the daily schedule of almost every famous creative person you can think of in a few paragraphs, from Bach to Tesla to Ayn Rand. Peering into the day to day lives of well known people was fascinating, but I was most interested in how efficient they were with their time. Many of the people featured in the book, especially the writers, sat down and worked for only two or three hours a day and often produced only several pages. It really changed my perspective on how creative work gets done. Especially when considering the hn culture of hyperproductivity. it was revealing to see how some of the greatest creative minds of all time respected the limits of their quality mental output.
  - I've tried to adapt my personal schedule to match some of their habits, and have generally felt better about being able to get a limited amount of creative work done in 24 hours. Come to see a new side of people who's work you know well, stay to get a better understanding of how they created great things.
- The Pragmatic Programmer
  - It has been recommended to me by a good developer that is self-taught like me. So far so good. Some things are a bit dated though.
  - Pragmatic Programmer is pretty good, but even better are Steve McConnell's books from the late 90's, "Rapid Development" and "Code Complete". They're both big and both published by Microsoft. Two strikes, yes, but don't be fooled. These books have so many nuggets that I've gone back to again and again as a programmer. "Code Complete", in particular. Neither book is a cover-to-cover read. They're both books you dip into for a tip, a skill, some perspective. But they've held up amazingly well, and for my money and time, they're both a step up from the Pragmatic Programmer. If you like what you found in "Pragmatic", you'll love "Code Complete".
- Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance
  - The book looks at what it means to say something has 'quality'. It didn't teach me any new philosophical methods or theories, but it did make me look at my own work differently and start asking: how can I make something with the highest quality? What compromises that quality? What is a method that leads to the highest quality? Translating that to my business life: in the startup scene I've scene a lot of startups treat lean as gospel (myself included at one point), and as a result they compromise on the quality that both themselves and their customers are happy with. So I certainly found it useful to have a book that made me think about this.
  - If you haven't read this book, do. Absolutely and without question life-changing. Also contains the best description and explanation of the scientific method I've ever read - so good that I put the book on the curriculum of a course on online advertising I ran this year!
- How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built
  - I was a voracious reader of programming books prior to reading Stewart Brand's "How Buildings Learn: What Happens After They're Built." However, it was this book that made me (finally) realize that some of the best programming books are not about programming at all. As a result I've cut back drastically on my "language-specific" programming books[1] and have sought programming-relevant books instead.
  - Armstrong's book on Erlang (2007) is a great read, so you're missing that. (Erlang itself I haven't really used much, but I like some of the concepts).
  - Alexandrescu's Modern C++ Design (2001) is a real eye-opener (though I wouldn't use most of the stuff from the latter half of book in real production).
  - Herb Sutter's books on Exception C++ (1999) are must-reads if you intend to use exceptions. at. all. [Whereupon, these books will convince you not to use exceptions in C++ :-) ]
- Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking
  - Fantastic book. If you are an introvert (and many here likely are) you should really consider this book an investment in understanding yourself. I can't count the number of times I was nodding my head in agreement, thinking I had been the only one to feel a certain way.

*** Job / career feelings
**** [2014-10-14 Tue]
***** Programming Bootcamps
Came across a NYTimes article [[[http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/us/web-era-trade-schools-feeding-a-need-for-code.html&assetType%3Dnyt_now?gwh%3DA572DC9B308EC2F4F8E17D6CF0CEFA6B&gwt%3Dpay&assetType%3Dnyt_now&_r%3D0][link]]] [[[https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id%3D8452758][HN]]] on programming bootcamps. The piece caused a feeling of sadness in me. Maybe it hit a nerve with my contrarian side. In my mind, the best path through life is the one less taken.

The article talked about how popular these schools have become.

It quotes a seamstress:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
“It’s a lot of hours, it’s exhausting, and each week I think I can’t do it anymore,” said Shakrah Yves, 31, who three months ago was working as a seamstress. “But each week I learn so much, and it’s so exciting to be able to build your own app.”
#+END_QUOTE

I feel like I am repeating my ill-fated attempt to break into finance. I am competing against a bunch of also-rans. Further, I view the tech labor market today as fragile. Easy venture capital money is fueling a lot of startups that otherwise might not exist. I can't say when, but at some point this trend will reverse itself. Just like it did for the tech industry 14 years ago.

At the risk of sounding elitist: the people entering tech right now are the people that do not belong there. They are chasing what looks like an easily available job. Easy VC money. They aren't there because of an interest in technology.

When the bubble pops, there's going to be a glut of people skilled in cobbling together code to make web apps, and little demand to do so.

[[file:~/clojure/hackerati-interval-web-app/test/hackerati_interval_web_app/schema_test.clj::(list%20{:url%20"http://foo.com"%20:description%20"Description%201"}))))][file:~/clojure/hackerati-interval-web-app/test/hackerati_interval_web_app/schema_test.clj::(list {:url "http://foo.com" :description "Description 1"}))))]]
***** Quirky
As similar feeling of sadness came over me as I was viewing the job listings for Quirky. They have 69 job listings up. I think it would be an amazing place to work. Maybe my dream company. And yet I don't see a single role there that I would be able to do. I also am not sure which of them I would be happy doing.

I am so afraid of being pigeonholed. I don't want to be "just an engineer", or "just a business schmuck".
