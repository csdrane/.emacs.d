**** Morning
Columbus Day. Thought Wix might not be open so I held off on going in. Instead went climbing.
**** Afternoon
Did a bit of coding but got hung up on a [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26346858/clojure-jdbc-mysql-errors-when-creating-table-with-composite-unique-constraint#26347812][JDBC Issue]].  
**** Dinner
Steak sandwich and baked potato. I think the cut was sirloin. Does not make a good sandwich. Gristle made each bite difficult to chew.

**** Bug bites?
I have what are either bug bites or hives all over:
- Left elbow
- Right elbow
- Right middle finger
- Below right hip
- Above arch of right foot
[[file://Users/christopherdrane/Documents/Personal/Photos/Personal/Bug%20Bites?][- Took some photos]]

I have had these for a number of days and I am now starting to get concerned. Brainstorm:
- Most likely not bed bugs: no pain; bites not in a row
- Don't look like mosquito bites: not as raised, seem to have persisted longer, haven't seen enough mosquitos for this to be the case
- Could it be an allegic reaction to Inga's pet dander? I seem to develop these in bed, so her dander would have had to have accumulated into the bed too.

**** Bug bites?
This morning only noticing "bites" on arch of right foot and right hip. No new bites, best as I can tell.

**** Laptop
Spent a good part of this morning cleaning my laptop. Last night it had sounded like it was on the fritz. The fans sounded like a racecar changing gears. So today I opened up the case and sprayed it down with compressed gas. Now it's idling 30 F lower and the awful noise is gone.

Woke up with my neck feeling stiff and in pain. Felt it coming on yesterday but much worse this morning.

**** Clojure things learned today
- println won't work properly necessarily when using threads. Instead, use (.println System/out <text>)

**** X-Editable
Spent way too long fucking around with this today. Wasted hours could have been avoided by a simple message warning that necessary options weren't specified.
