I am in the middle of trying to make a career change. My work history is in finance / real estate. Most recently I worked for a large real estate investment fund. I was really unhappy at that job, and the stress of it triggered at least one, maybe two, major depressive episodes. 

I have spent a long time contemplating my next career move. I have no interest in returning to finance / RE. Ever since I was little I've had a strong interest in technology. In high school I dabbled in learning C  I was very interested in reverse engineering. I had bootlegged copies of Numega Soft Ice and IDA installed. Technical manuals from Intel on the x86 instruction set, from Microsoft on the PE file format. I was, in short, a huge nerd. A very antisocial nerd. 

In college I decided to be someone else. I discontinued my hobby, and I pretended to be ignorant in computers. I had conflated being interested in computers with being lonely. 

Wall Street at the time was on fire, so I imitated one of my good friends and decided that I wanted to be an investment banker. Nevermind that I don't care that much about money and hate long hours.
