Spoke with Myra in the Accounts Payable Dept. Gave her the check number. She didn't have detail on what the rebate was about. I gave her my email address. A processor should email me within 24 - 48 hours with backup for the rebate.

Spoke again with Myra. Said I should receive a response within 24 hours.
