# Corner of BerkScraper and FunFacts

CBFF is the first web app I ever wrote. At the time, I was interested in value investing and I posted occassionally on a message board called [Corner of Berkshire and Fairfax](http://www.cornerofberkshireandfairfax.ca).

The board had a forum for members to submit investment ideas. Ideas were posted with a consistent format that allowed for stock tickers to be easily parsed. CBFF scraped investment ideas forum. It added board members to a SQL database along with their investment ideas. It then pulled stock price data from Yahoo Finance to evaluate investment performance.

The results of this project can be found at [cobff.chrisdrane.com](http://cobff.chrisdrane.com/) (no longer maintainced).

## Dependencies

* [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) for parsing. 
* [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) as the intermediary between Python and the database
* [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com)
