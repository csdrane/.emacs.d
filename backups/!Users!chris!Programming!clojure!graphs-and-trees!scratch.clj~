;; What are graphs?
;; - An ordered collection of vertices and edges.
;; What's a graph, and what's a tree?
;; - Trees are a subclass of graphs. They are an undirected graph in which only one path connects any two vertices.
;; Describe what a directed graph is versus undirected
;; - A directed graph is a graph with directed edges. Directed edges could be described as one in which vertex A points to B, but B does not map to A.
