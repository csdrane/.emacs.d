* Methodology

1) Weight should be measured every morning, prior to eating, and after any urgent bathroom activities.
2) Photos should be taken every Tuesday.
   - Method
     - Stand camera vertically on nightstand. Use front camera + timer.
     - Photos should be taken head on, and 90 degrees to the side.

* Diet Eliminations

1) Black coffee only. No more iced lattes.
2) Stop buying milk and peanut butter.
3) Replace potatos with different vegetable.
4) Do not buy or consume any of the following under *any* circumstances:
   - Chips
   - French fries
   - Soda
5) No more Joyce Bakery pastries on Thursday mornings. Have breakfast at home instead.
6) Look for a bread lower in carbs and calories.
7) MAYBE: Swap mustard for mayo (~ 90 cal.)
